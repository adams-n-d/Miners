VFDT - Very Fast Decision Tree using the Hoeffding bound

Run:

$ python vt.py reviews.txt

where reviews.txt is of the format delivered by the
SNAP Amazon Review dataset
See:
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html

heurisitic.py calculates the information gain statistics, typically used for the ID4 algorithm but applied in this case to the VFDT

txtCls.py creates the classifiers that are used to provide features to the decision tree classifier

parser.py reads and parses the text data file into a dictionary of features. When dealing with a differently structured file or database, one may adapt their own parsing functions.

vt.py contains the main decision tree building loop and also the testing loop for evaluation.
